# struct
This package is not useful at this stage and may never be.
Testing package publishing and consumption and if I want ot do it in private
I have to have a paid account.

Here I am being shameless.

The idea of this package is that it will be a collection of customised 
Data Structures and helper methods.

**Usage**
<br>
const {fibonacci, LinkedList} = require('@aquajax/struct');

fibonacci(10)
const list = new LinkedList();

for( let i = 0; i<10000; i++)
list.insert(i);
